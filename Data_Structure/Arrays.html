        <h1>Arrays</h1><br>
        <p class="font">
            Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. <br>
            Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index. <br>
            All arrays consist of contiguous memory locations. The lowest address corresponds to the first element and the highest address to the last element. <br>

        <h2>Declaring Arrays</h2><br>
        <p class="font">
            This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid C data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type double, use this statement −
            Here balance is a variable array which is sufficient to hold up to 10 double numbers.
            <p class="diff-1">
                double balance[10];
            </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Intializing Arrays</h2><br>
        <p class="font">
            You can initialize an array in C either one by one or using a single statement as follows −
            <p class="diff-1">
                double balance[5] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
            </p>
        </p>
        <p class="font">
            
            The number of values between braces { } cannot be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].

If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write −
<p class="diff-1">double balance[] = {1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0};
</p>
